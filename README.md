[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bullet-db/bullet-bql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bullet-db/bullet-bql) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/bullet-db/bullet-bql/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/bullet-db/bullet-bql?branch=master) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/yahoo/maven/bullet-bql/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/yahoo/maven/bullet-bql/_latestVersion)

>BQL is a SQL-like query language specifically designed for the [Bullet](https://bullet-db.github.io/) query engine, which provides an easy-to-use yet powerful interactive SQL-like interface. 

This project contains a BQL parser built in [ANTLR 4](http://www.antlr.org/). A BQL query will be parsed, classified, validated and extracted to a [Bullet](https://bullet-db.github.io/) Query or [Bullet JSON](https://bullet-db.github.io/ws/api/).

## Background

Bullet-BQL is created to provide users with a friendly SQL-like layer to manipulate the power of [Bullet](https://bullet-db.github.io/) query engine. Users can write a simple BQL query instead of [Bullet JSON](https://bullet-db.github.io/ws/api/), which saves time and eases the learning curve for people familiar with SQL.

## Install

* The Bullet-BQL artifact can be obtained from [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter?filterByPkgName=bullet-bql).

* To run the tool from the command line, first compile:

    `mvn clean compile` 

    Then you can use bullet-bql to parse BQL strings into [Bullet JSON](https://bullet-db.github.io/ws/api/) queries. To run:
    
    `mvn exec:java`
     
* Bullet-BQL is currently being integrated into [Bullet-Service](https://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-service/), and will provide a BQL endpoint directly. 

## Usage

* Build a [Bullet](https://bullet-db.github.io/) Query from a BQL string.

    Simply construct a `BulletQueryBuilder` and call `buildQuery(String bql)`. A [Bullet](https://bullet-db.github.io/) Query is returned.

* You can change the max query length in `BQLConfig` by altering the `.yaml`.

## Data Types

* **Null**: `NULL`.

* **Boolean**: `TRUE`, `FALSE`.

* **Integer**: 32-bit signed two’s complement integer with a minimum value of `-2^31` and a maximum value of `2^31 - 1`. Example: `65`.

* **Long**: 64-bit signed two’s complement integer with a minimum value of `-2^63 + 1` and a maximum value of `2^63 - 1`. Example: `9223372036854775807`, `-9223372036854775807`.

* **Float**: 32-bit inexact, variable-precision with a minimum value of `2^-149` and a maximum value of `(2-2^-23)·2^127`. Example: `1.70141183E+38`, `1.17549435E-38`, `0.15625`.

* **Double**: 64-bit inexact, variable-precision with a minimum value of `2^-1074` and a maximum value of `(2-2^-52)·2^1023`. Example: `1.7976931348623157E+308`, `.17976931348623157E+309`, `4.9E-324`.

* **String**: character string which can have escapes. Example: `'this is a string'`, `'this is ''another'' string'`.

* **Identifier**: representation of a field. Unquoted identifier must start with a letter or `_`. Example: `column_name`, `column_name.foo`, `column_name.foo.bar`, `column_name[0].bar`, or `"123column"`.

* **All**: representation of all fields. Example: `*`.
